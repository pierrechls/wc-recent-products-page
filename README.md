Recent Products Page for WooCommerce is an extension for Woocommerce. I developed this plugin because WooCommerce has *[recent_products]* shortcode but it lacks paging, sorting and filtering which you can usually find on regular WooCommerce catalog page. With our RecentProducts Page plugin you can setup Recent Products Page for WooCommerce where you can display all products order by date.
