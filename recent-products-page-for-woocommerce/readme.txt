Recent Products Page is an extension for Woocommerce which enables you to have real recent products page with paging, sorting and filtering.

== Description ==

Recent Products Page for WooCommerce is an extension for Woocommerce. Since WooCommerce is popular we decided that it would be neat to extend it with real WordPress page which displays products recent products. We developed this plugin because WooCommerce has recentproducts widget and shortcode but it lacks paging, sorting and filtering which you can usually find on regular WooCommerce catalog page. With our RecentProducts Page plugin you can setup Recent Products Page for WooCommerce where you can display all products order by date.
